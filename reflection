Reference Guide for GUI Calculator
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDxEGtMNPtA
This video explains formatting and designing a guide program from start to finish.
Includes changing font (size and design as well as color). It also includes editing 
actions that a button can take and how to jump back and forth between editing that and changing formatting.

watched this video first as a refresher since I havenâ€™t worked with GUI in a while.
This allowed me to pick up the essentials on how to create the project and get to the
design page with all the options that let you drag in buttons and panes.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/script/ScriptEngine.html
Describes the different methods within ScriptEngine and give reference to which things
are needed to get the method to run.

Pseudo Code
Method-buttonplusAction
First expression += next expression
Set expression  = expression

Method-read and evaluate
ScriptManager
Total = (double) evaluate expression through script manager 

Method-clear calculator
Set expression= blank

Main method 
Run calculator()

Reference Guide for Reverse Number Guess
https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
Reference guide for the random number class of python. Used to produce the 
computers first guess of what my number is. Spits out random integer (when specified)
between a desired min and max.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-creating-a-button-in-tkinter/
Used for creating buttons in the GUI.

Pseudo Code
Method-getEntry
Create variable for computer guess, user number
Secret number = user input
Guess= random between 1-100
Ask user if guess matches input
Run program	//recursive statement allows user to choose if number is higher, lower or correct

Method-lower
Make the max = previous guess
Guess = (int) (guess + min)/2 	//decreases possible choices. Add previous guess to minimum pick the number in the middle
Ask user if guess matches input
Run program	//recursive statement allows user to choose if number is higher, lower or correct

Method-higher
Make the min = previous guess
Guess = (int) (guess + max)/2 	//decreases possible choices. Add previous guess to max pick the number in the middle
Ask user if guess matches input
Run program	//recursive statement allows user to choose if number is higher, lower or correct

Method- is correct
Returns an exit statement
Allows user to input a new number and continue

Reflection
This assignment was not difficult because of having to code in different languages and get used to them quickly. It was 
made much easier by the fact that we were instructed to research and gather materials on how we would code our assignments
before even starting. After gathering these materials, the assignment proved less difficult as we knew where each part of 
the assignment could be found just by jumping back and forth between the resources. The pseudo code was also a great help. 
Usually, I do not write pseudo code, but I do usually spend days thinking about how I will code an assignment before I sit 
down and get working on it. This forces me to put my ideas on paper and revise them as I progressed instead of coming up with
a ton of ideas and then just working on whichever one I could remember at the time. In addition, putting the pseudo code on 
paper allows you to start thinking about an approach and jump back to research to find more ways of approaching or enhancing
that method before committing to certain techniques or methods.
