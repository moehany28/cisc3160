Reflection Lab 3

For this assignment i worked on working our all errors i had in my code originally. The issue with lex and yacc is the languages are very
technical when it comes to their syntax. One small mistake throws the program into shambles. This is different from other languages with compilers
built in because they will let you know the issues exist before running but what i found in my trials is that the code will run but will just be obsolete.
I also wanted to ensure that my code would run with multiple numbers to see if the code had limiters on how many numbers could be in one expression.
This excersice helped me focus on understanding the technical aspects of lex and yacc but i still am not too comfortable working with them.
What i want to try soon is translating this code into java. I wrote the code for a caluclator in java a while back but writing the lexer and parser 
might prove to be much more difficult. Writing the grammer for a wholel anguage is much more difficult than what we seem to understand because we have
already been given languages and IDEs with the languages built. This makes writing whatever code we wish much easier. This gives us a great
advantage over those who have written code over the years and built the languages from the ground up.
