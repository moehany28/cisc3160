Reflection Lab 2

This assignment was alot harder than i thought it would be. Lex and yacc are very new to me and tehrefore i found myself watching alot of videos to 
figure out what was messing up my code. Writing a calculator in java was much simpler and that lead me to believe this may bear a lot of resemblance
to previous work I have done. In the beginning, i had a large issue figuring out how to run the code but once i figured it out it took me a long
time to work out all the small issues i had with the code. Including error statements came at the end because my code generally ran with multiple
so until i was able to work out the code errors i was not able to add erros that may be caused by the user of the program. Overall, this assignment
shows us how complex compilers are and how they are much more sophistacted than we think they are. We have the luxury of using ide's with compilers
already there for us and this shows us that there is much more at work than we see in foresight.
