DESIGN DOCUMENT

This code produces an integer response from any simple arithmetic expression. The symbols or operations allowed are as follows:
Addition (+) - adds two integers together
Subtraction (-) - subtracts the second integer from the first
Multiplication (*) - multiplies the two integers together
Division ( / ) - divides the first integer by the second returning an integer value
Modulo ( % ) - returns the remiander after dividing the first integer by the second. will return 0 if first is perfectly divisible by second.

In addition to these operations the user may also use parenthesis ('(', ')') to describe the order of operations and dictate which operations should be carried out first.
After inputting a valid expression, The user will recieve the result of their operation followed by a message stating their operation was 
written in a format allowed by the calculator.

If the user inputs a command that would produce an error on a scientific calculator (i.e. a number with an operation after not followed by a number, an open 
parenthesis that does not get closed) the user will recieve an error message stating the expression they inputted was invalid by mathematical standards and
therefore could not be carried out by the calculator.
